# AutomatedFoodOrderingApp in Django
This project is a Django-backend automated food ordering system, where users can register as either customers or cafe administrators. Customers can view menus, add items to their cart, place orders, make payments through the Daraja API (M-Pesa), earn loyalty points, and redeem points for food items. Cafe administrators can manage food items, categories, dining tables, and view daily orders and reviews. Both users and admins receive notifications for important events, such as payments and point redemptions.

- Authentication: Use djoser or django-allauth for user registration and authentication.
- Authorization: Customers and cafeadmins have different permissions for accessing various views and functionalities.
- Custom Permissions: Ensure only cafeadmins can manage the menu, orders, and tables.

# Payment Integration
We use the Daraja API (M-Pesa) for handling mobile payments.

Payment Flow:
Customer places an order.
Payment request is sent to Daraja API.
M-Pesa confirms the payment.
Order is marked as "Paid" upon confirmation.

## Setup:
Follow the official Daraja API documentation to obtain your API keys.
Implement the payment views and handle callbacks securely.

# Loyalty Points System
- Customers earn 1 point for every 100 KSH spent on orders.
- Points can be redeemed for specific food items.
- Points are awarded automatically after a successful payment using Django signals.

# Notifications
- django-notifications-hq is used to send notifications.
- Notifications are sent to both customers and cafeadmins when:
1. Payment is successful.
2. Loyalty points are redeemed.
3. Orders are placed or updated.

# Order Review System
Customers can review their orders, but only on the day the order was placed.
Reviews are linked to specific orders, and cafeadmins can view daily reviews.

# Admin Features
Cafeadmins can:
- Manage food categories and items.
- Manage special offers.
- Track and update order statuses.
- View daily reports on orders and reviews.
- Create orders directly from the counter for walk-in customers.
